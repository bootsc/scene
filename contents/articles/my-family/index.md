I had never driven the Bel Air before and was kinda nervous.  But it was so smooth and relaxing (not to mention gorgeous) that I kinda relaxed into it.  I almost forgot I was pregnant.  Oh and that the breaks would occasionally not work.

I hadn't been feeling well and we'd nearly turned around earlier that day.  I had the kind of morning sickness that doesn't think it should be restricted to the morning hours.  But I figured I might as well feel sick somewhere beautiful rather than back at the apartment.

And it truly was beautiful.  While everyone else in California flocks to the coast (iconic) or interstate (fastest), David knew a perfect windy, wooded road down the middle of the peninsula.  It was bizarre to be in such a quiet dense woods but also be right next to several super-populated metropolises.

Had some tacos, probably walked on the boardwalk, then drove out of town, starting the short journey home.

After a few minutes, I kind of forgot that David was taking pictures.  The loud hum of the car made conversation just tricky and we were both focusing on our own little worlds; his the camera, mine the car.

And isn’t that when the magic always happens?  When you are “in the zone”?
