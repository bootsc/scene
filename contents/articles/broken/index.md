![Shot To Death][shot]

“… did you see that?!”  His eyes were twitching with excitement.  He couldn’t have stopped the corners of his mouth from curving up even if his life depended on it.  Excitement, for sure, but he also smiles when he’s nervous.  And he knew I was borderline grouchy and didn’t want to stop.

“What?” I said quickly, as un-annoyed as I could.  For some reason I pretended like I didn’t know what he was talking about.  Of course I knew- anyone who’d spend 5 minutes with the guy could have guessed.  We’d just come down from Independence pass and were streaming along the tapering foothills of colorado, soft rolling hills all the remain of the jagged barren peaks of an hour ago.

I wanted to make it to our stop for the night, to find a place to stay and get something reasonable for dinner, all before the sleeping infant time bomb in the back seat exploded into screeches of carseat disapproval.  

But I didn’t want to say no.  This was kind of the point of the whole road trip after all; to take our time and see the sights.  To stop and smell the flowers, so to speak.  Plus I didn’t want this to be another one of those little stories he told for years and years about how whatever happened (me, in this case) and he missed the shot.

So after a few minutes of playing-dumb (both sides: “are you sure it’s ok?”  “I mean… if you have to…”  “ok then…!” “well are you sure what you saw?”) he made a quick u turn across the deserted highway and drove back to the site.

We drove super slowly a few hundred yards up a gravel road with our necks crocked over the dashboard trying to see up the steep hills in front of us.  The ambiguous public/private status made me a bit uncomfortable, only because I grew up in the country and i know how particular people can be about their land and how they know immediately if someone is a stranger.  And how they like their guns.  It was probably public but only the 10 people who lived up there ever drove it.  

We pulled off to the side and I stared out into the field, trying to see what he saw.  “This is stupid” I probably muttered to myself while he dug his bag out of our packed trunk.  But while I did think it was kind of silly, I was also intrigued.  David had phenomenal taste and an impeccable eye.  If he thought something would make an amazing photo, it probably was going to make an amazing photo.  At that point, I hadn’t seem many “making of the shots” and I was curious.  Maybe this is how a groupie feels?

As he lugged his camera out into the field, my nervousness about private property and guns quadrupled.  But there was nothing to be done at that point so I sat and watched.  I noticed the fog and I wished my phone had reception.  I wondered at our luck that the babe was still sleeping and I cursed him for taking forever (ok, ok: 10 minutes).

That night, we ended up in a mediocre motel room with an awkward smell that made me really look forward to not staying in hotel rooms anymore.  But our dinner was surprisingly upscale and even trendy- surprised us both in such a small remote town- and the next day at the Sand Dunes was gorgeous.  Nothing would have been different in the slightest, let alone better, if we hadn’t taken 20 minutes to pull over at the rusty old car.  And to this day, I really love the shot.
